# Joke Teller Project

The Joke Teller project is a simple web application that fetches jokes from an external API and displays them to the user. It allows users to choose categories of jokes and the type of joke they want to hear. Users can click a button to receive and enjoy a joke. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and entertaining experience.
